# OpenAI Realtime Elixir Demo

This project demonstrates the integration of OpenAI's Realtime API with an Elixir/Phoenix application.

## Getting Started

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser to see the demo page.

## Features

* Demonstrates real-time interaction with OpenAI's API
* Built with Elixir and Phoenix for robust, scalable performance
* Simple, user-friendly interface for testing API capabilities

## Configuration

Before running the application, make sure to set up your OpenAI API credentials. You'll need to add your API key to the configuration.
